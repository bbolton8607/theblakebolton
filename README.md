Portfolio Website made with WordPress

This is a WordPress Project I started back in 2022 and was hired before I could finish it.

🌟 Introducing My Custom WordPress Theme: A Showcase of Creativity and Craftsmanship

As a passionate developer, I meticulously crafted my personal portfolio site using a custom WordPress theme. Here’s what makes it stand out:

Bootstrap-Free Design 🚫🔗:
I intentionally avoided Bootstrap to create a truly unique and tailored experience.
Instead, I harnessed the power of CSS Grid and media queries to ensure responsiveness across devices. No bloated frameworks here!

Elegant and Efficient Contact Section 📞✉️:
Forget generic contact plugins! I handcrafted a custom PHP contact section that seamlessly integrates with my theme.
Users can reach out directly, and I receive their messages without any third-party intermediaries.

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) 🎨🔧:
To empower customization, I leveraged ACF in various areas of my theme.
Whether it’s tweaking layouts, adding new content types, or adjusting styles, ACF gives me unparalleled flexibility.

Vanilla JavaScript Magic ✨🔍:
I sprinkled some vanilla JavaScript goodness throughout my site.
From smooth animations to interactive elements, my code brings life to the user experience.

PHP Mastery 🐘🔥:
Crafting custom templates, handling dynamic content, and optimizing performance—PHP is my secret sauce.
The result? A seamless blend of aesthetics and functionality.

Clean, Minimalist Design 🎨📏:
My theme embraces simplicity. Clean lines, ample whitespace, and a focus on showcasing my work.
Because sometimes less truly is more.
